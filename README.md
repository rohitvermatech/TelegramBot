simple python based Telegram echo Bot 

# Webhook Setup
Setting a webhook in Telegram is very easy. You just need to send a request to,

https://api.telegram.org/bot{bot_token}/setWebhook?url={your_server_url}

your_server_url is the URL Telegram will send updates to. 

Opening this link in your browser works too.
